**Some bashrc magic!**
===================

Hey! 
here I'll be showing my recent **bashrc customizations**[^bashrc_customization], take a peek and see if it suits your needs.

----------
My bashrc has been divided into three separate files, each file will holds different functionality: 

> -  **.bash_Aliases**    file consists some nice aliases which I have collected along my daily work..
> - **.bash_functions** file consists some valuable functions which will save you a valuable time.
> - **.bash_colors**   -   file consists some predefined colors for future use.

> **Tip:** You should take a look and explore those **bash** files it **comes quite handy from time to time**. 

---
  Take a sip from your coffee <i class="icon-coffee"></i> and **enjoy** the process of exploring and coding.
